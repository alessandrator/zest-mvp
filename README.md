## 🔐 Authentication & Session Management

The application implements a secure authentication system with several key improvements:

### Session Handling
- **Direct Dashboard Redirect**: After successful login, users are redirected directly to their dashboard
- **Enhanced Middleware**: Dual session validation using both `getUser()` and `getSession()` for reliability
- **Cookie Synchronization**: Proper timing ensures session cookies are set before redirects
- **Redirect Loop Prevention**: Improved logic prevents infinite redirect loops during authentication

### Error Handling
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error messages for authentication failures
- **Configuration Detection**: Graceful handling when Supabase is not configured
- **Fallback Validation**: Multiple validation layers for session verification

### Security Features
- **Middleware Protection**: Automatic redirect to login for protected routes

## 🧪 Testing the Application

### Testing Signup Form and Authentication

#### Local Testing
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/signup](http://localhost:3000/signup)

3. **Test Password Validation**:
   - Try password "password" → Should show "Password must contain at least one number"
   - Try password "password123" → Should show "Password must contain at least one uppercase letter"  
   - Try password "Password123" → Should pass validation

4. **Test Role-based Fields**:
   - Select "Student", "Influencer", or "Consumer" → Company field should be hidden
   - Select "Brand" or "School Admin" → Company field should appear

5. **Test Form Submission**:
   - With valid data, form will attempt to call Supabase (may show "Supabase not configured" if not set up)
   - With invalid data, clear validation errors should display

#### Features to Test
- ✅ Password validation (8+ chars, uppercase, number)
- ✅ Real-time validation feedback with specific error messages
